#include formats

In c programming there are two common formats for #include:
1. #include<headerFile.h>   // the angle brackets say to look in the standard system directories
2. #include"myFiles.h"  // the quatation mark say to look in the current directory


Disk drive full path is allowed, but discouraged since it is not portable
1. #include<C:\ProgramFiles\Aman\Something.h>  // to specific
2. #include<sys/file.h>    // Relative and portable path to the standard locations
