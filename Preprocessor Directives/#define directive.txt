1.  The #define directive is used to "define" preprocessor "variables".
2.  The define preprocessor directive can be used to globally replace a word with a number.
3.  It acts as if an editor did a global search-and-replace edit of the file.


#define directive can be used for debugging.
we can have print statements that we only want active when debugging.
we can "protect" them in a "ifdef" block as follow:

#define DEBUG
#ifdef DEBUG
[print statement]
#endif

#undef DEBUG


---------------- MACROS USING #DEFINE ----------------
we can also create macros using #define
macros operate much like functions, but because they are expanded in place and are generally faster
#define PI 3.14
