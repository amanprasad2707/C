    automatic storage class
    default value: garbage
    scope: Local to the function body they are difined in 
    lifetime: till the end of the function block they are defined in
    A variable defined without any storage class specification is by default an automatic variable
    for example int harry and auto int harry are same
    automatic storage class are local variable



    external storage class  (extern keyword)
    default value: zero
    scope: global to the program they are defined in
    lifetime: they are available throughtout the lifetime of the program
    a global variable can be changed by any function in the program


    static variable (static storage class)
    scope: local to the block they are defined in 
    default value: zero
    lifetime: they are available throughtout the lifetime of the program
    a static variable remains under existence for use within the function for entire program run
    func(){
        static int a = 5;  //6
        a++;
    }

    register variable  (register storage class)
    scope: local to the function they are declared in
    default value: garbage
    lifetime: they are available till the end of the function block, in which the variable is defined
    register variables requests the compiler to store the variable in the CPU register instead of storing in the memory to have faster access
