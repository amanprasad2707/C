---------------  preprocessor directives ---------------

1.  Preprocessor is a kind of automated editor that modifies a copy of the original source code
2.  The #include directive causes the preprocessor to fetch the contents of some other file to be included in the present file
3.  In C programming there are two common formats for #includes:
4.  This file may in turn #include some other file(s) which may in turn do the same.
5.  Most commonly the #included files have a ".h" extension, indicating that they are header files.
6.  The #define directive is used to "define" preprocessor "variables"
